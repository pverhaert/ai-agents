# Google NotebookLM

NotebookLM is completely different from other AI tools. It is not a chatbot that "knows everything." It is a **Research
Assistant** that "knows nothing"—except what you teach it. This prevents hallucinations and makes it the ultimate tool
for studying and learning.

## The Grounded Research Partner

**Developer**: Google Labs

**Description**: NotebookLM uses a technology called RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to "ground" the AI in your
specific documents. You upload PDFs, text files, or website links, and the AI becomes an expert on *only* that material.
It is famous for its "Audio Overview" feature, which turns your boring documents into an engaging, viral-style podcast.

**Key Features**:

- **Source Grounding**: The AI answers questions using *only* your uploaded sources. If the answer isn't in your files,
  it says "I don't know."
- **Inline Citations**: Every sentence it writes includes a citation number. Click it to jump to the exact paragraph in
  your PDF.
- **Audio Overviews**: Generates a stunningly realistic "Deep Dive" podcast where two AI hosts banter and discuss your
  documents.
- **Video Overviews**: Generates a realistic "Deep Dive" video of the selected documents.
- **Study Guides**: Automatically turns your notes into FAQs, timelines, or briefing documents.
- **Privacy**: Your data is used to answer your questions but is not used to train the public Google models.

**Best For**: Students, researchers, lawyers, and anyone who needs to understand complex documents quickly.

  material.
