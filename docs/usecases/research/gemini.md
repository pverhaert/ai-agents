# **Strategic Analysis of High-Performance Domestic Espresso Systems: <br>Evaluating Touchscreen-Enabled Platforms Under €600 for the Belgian Market**

## **1\. Executive Summary**

The democratization of high-quality espresso preparation has reached a pivotal juncture in the Belgian consumer electronics market. A convergence of technological maturation and aggressive pricing strategies has pushed advanced features—formerly the exclusive domain of premium appliances exceeding €1,000—into the competitive mid-range segment. This comprehensive research report evaluates the current landscape of DeLonghi espresso machines available in Belgium, specifically targeting the stringent requirements of a sub-€600 retail price, a dedicated touchscreen interface, and support for multi-user customization (User Profiles).

The analysis reveals that the Belgian market is currently experiencing a transitional phase where three primary architectures compete for dominance: the compact and modular **Rivelia (EXAM440.35)**, the robust and capacity-focused **Magnifica Plus (ECAM320.60/70)**, and the value-oriented **Magnifica Evo Next (ECAM310.60)**. While all three platforms utilize DeLonghi’s foundational stainless steel conical burr grinding technology and removable brew groups, they diverge significantly in user interface philosophy, thermal management, and beverage customization depth.

Data gathered from major Belgian retailers—including Vanden Borre, Coolblue, MediaMarkt, and Art & Craft—indicates that while Recommended Retail Prices (RRP) for the most desirable models often hover between €629 and €699, street prices fluctuate significantly. Notably, the **Magnifica Plus** and **Rivelia** are prime candidates for deep discounting during promotional windows such as Black Friday, bringing them within the €600 budgetary constraint.1

The investigation highlights a critical distinction in "touch" technology. The **Magnifica Plus** and **Rivelia** employ genuine, smartphone-grade capacitive touchscreens that allow for swipe navigation and rich animation.3 In contrast, the **Magnifica Evo Next** utilizes a TFT display flanked by "soft-touch" static buttons, a distinction that fundamentally alters the user experience and may impact satisfaction for users specifically requesting a "touchscreen".5

Furthermore, technical analysis of brewing mechanics suggests the **Magnifica Plus** offers a distinct advantage for espresso purists through its ability to dose a larger coffee puck (up to 15-18g) compared to the Rivelia’s more compact brew unit.6 However, the Rivelia counters with its innovative "Bean Switch System," addressing the multi-user need for varied bean types (e.g., decaf vs. regular).7

This report provides an exhaustive technical breakdown, comparative performance metrics, and strategic buying recommendations, positioning the **Magnifica Plus** as the optimal "all-rounder" for the specified criteria, provided the consumer leverages specific retail opportunities in the Belgian market.



## **2\. Market Context: The Belgian Espresso Landscape**

### **2.1. The Evolution of the "Super-Automatic" Segment**

The Belgian domestic coffee market has historically been characterized by a sophisticated appreciation for quality, bridging the gap between Northern European filter coffee preferences and Southern European espresso culture. In recent years, there has been a decisive shift away from capsule-based systems toward "bean-to-cup" or super-automatic machines. This transition is driven by long-term cost efficiency (whole beans being cheaper per cup than capsules) and the ecological imperative to reduce waste.

However, the "super-automatic" label previously implied a trade-off: convenience came at the cost of customization. Early generations of these machines offered a static menu where "Coffee" meant the same extraction parameters for every user. The modern requirement for **User Profiles**—as specified in the research directive—reflects the reality of the contemporary household. It is no longer sufficient for a machine to simply make espresso; it must remember that User A prefers a 40ml extraction at high temperature, while User B desires a 120ml Lungo at medium intensity. DeLonghi has responded to this by migrating software architectures from their flagship *Maestosa* and *PrimaDonna* lines down into the *Magnifica* and *Rivelia* series.9

### **2.2. The Digital Interface as a Differentiator**

The ubiquity of smartphones has fundamentally altered consumer expectations regarding appliance interaction. The request for a "touchscreen" under €600 is indicative of a desire for an interface that is intuitive, visual, and dynamic.

* **Visual Feedback:** Modern full-color TFT (Thin Film Transistor) displays provide real-time feedback on the brewing process, animated guides for maintenance (e.g., showing exactly which tray to empty), and visual representations of beverage size.  
* **Navigation Hierarchy:** Touchscreens allow for deeper menu structures without cluttering the control panel. Settings for water hardness, auto-off timers, and temperature profiles are accessible via swipe menus rather than cryptic button combinations required on older LCD or LED-based machines.

### **2.3. Belgian Retail Dynamics and Pricing Strategy**

Understanding the pricing landscape is essential for identifying machines that fit the "Under €600" criterion. The Belgian market is subject to specific value-added tax (VAT) structures and intense competition among electronics retailers.

* **The "Eco-Cheque" Influence:** A unique feature of the Belgian market is the "Eco-Cheque" system, where employers provide tax-free vouchers for purchasing eco-friendly products. Many A-rated espresso machines qualify. While this report focuses on the gross Euro price, consumers should be aware that their effective cash outlay could be reduced by up to €250 if they utilize Eco-Cheques at retailers like **Krefel** or **Vanden Borre**.10  
* **Price Elasticity and Promotions:** The analysis of pricing snippets reveals high volatility. For instance, the **DeLonghi Rivelia** has been observed at prices ranging from €549 2 to €699 7 depending on the retailer and the specific inclusion of the automatic milk carafe.  
* **Black Friday Relevance:** The timing of the purchase is critical. Snippets explicitly mention Black Friday deals for 2025, suggesting that models currently priced at €650 (like the fully equipped Rivelia or Magnifica Plus) are expected to drop into the €550–€599 range during the November promotional window.1 This seasonal elasticity effectively expands the pool of "budget-compliant" machines for the patient buyer.



## **3\. Technical Architecture of DeLonghi Mid-Range Platforms**

To accurately compare the **Rivelia**, **Magnifica Plus**, and **Magnifica Evo Next**, one must first understand the shared technical DNA that underpins DeLonghi’s manufacturing philosophy. These machines are not built on entirely unique platforms but rather share core components that dictate their fundamental reliability and extraction quality.

### **3.1. The Grinding System: Stainless Steel Conical Burrs**

At the heart of every super-automatic machine lies the grinder. All three primary contenders in this report utilize DeLonghi’s proprietary **stainless steel conical burr grinder**.13

#### **3.1.1. Material Science: Steel vs. Ceramic**

Unlike competitors such as Philips/Saeco, which often employ flat ceramic burrs, DeLonghi is committed to steel.

* **Durability:** Stainless steel is less brittle than ceramic. In the event of a foreign object (like a small stone) entering the hopper—a rare but possible occurrence with agricultural products like coffee beans—steel burrs are more likely to jam without shattering, whereas ceramic burrs often suffer catastrophic failure.  
* **Precision:** Steel burrs can be machined to incredibly sharp tolerances, producing a particle distribution that is often multimodal, which is beneficial for espresso extraction as it allows for a dense puck structure that resists high-pressure water flow, creating rich crema.

#### **3.1.2. Adjustability and "Bean Adapt"**

The standard DeLonghi grinder offers **13 manual adjustment settings**.5 This granularity is vital. As beans age, they degas and become more brittle, requiring a finer grind to maintain the same flow rate.

* **Bean Adapt Technology:** Featured prominently in the **Rivelia** and **La Specialista Touch**, this is a software layer that interfaces with the grinder.8 While the physical adjustment may still be manual or electronically assisted, the machine guides the user. The user inputs the bean type (e.g., 100% Arabica) and roast level via the touchscreen, and the machine recommends the optimal grind setting, dose, and temperature. This "assisted dialing-in" lowers the barrier to entry for achieving barista-quality extraction.

### **3.2. The Brewing Unit: The Engine of Extraction**

DeLonghi’s brew group design is a defining characteristic of their engineering approach.

#### **3.2.1. Removability and Hygiene**

In the Belgian climate, which can be humid, the internal hygiene of a coffee machine is paramount. DeLonghi uses a **removable brew group**.9 This unit can be accessed from behind the water tank or a side panel and rinsed under tap water.

* **Analysis:** This contrasts with brands like Jura, where the brew unit is fixed internally. While fixed units often have sophisticated self-cleaning cycles, the physical ability to remove, inspect, and rinse the DeLonghi unit offers peace of mind regarding mold prevention and oil buildup removal without relying solely on chemical tablets.

#### **3.2.2. Dosing Capacity and Puck Size**

A critical differentiator identified in the research is the **variable dosing capacity**.

* **Magnifica Plus Advantage:** Deep technical analysis from user communities and technical reviews indicates that the **Magnifica Plus** (and the older Dinamica Plus) possesses a brew unit capable of accepting a larger dose of ground coffee—up to **15-18 grams**.6  
* **Rivelia Constraints:** The **Rivelia**, designed for compactness, appears to utilize a slightly modified or shorter brew unit arrangement that saturates at a lower dose, estimated around **12-14 grams**.6  
* **Implication:** A larger coffee puck allows for a higher ratio of coffee to water. For users who prefer a strong, intense double espresso or a rich base for a latte, the Magnifica Plus offers a higher "ceiling" for intensity. The Rivelia can still make strong coffee, but it may require the "Doppio+" feature (which uses a specific pre-infusion strategy) to mimic the intensity that the Magnifica Plus achieves through sheer mass of coffee.

### **3.3. Hydraulic Systems: 15 Bar vs. 19 Bar Pumps**

The marketing specifications often highlight pump pressure, but the nuance lies in the application.

* **15 Bar Standard:** The **Magnifica Plus** and **Evo Next** operate with a **15 bar** pump.5 This is the industry standard for vibration pumps. It provides ample overhead to ensure that, after passing through the thermoblock and piping, roughly 9 bars of pressure hit the coffee puck.  
* **19 Bar Enhancement:** The **Rivelia** is equipped with a **19 bar** pump.20  
* **Analysis:** Does 19 bar make better coffee? Not necessarily. Espresso is best extracted at 9 bars. However, a 19 bar pump offers a flatter pressure curve and potentially greater durability. It ensures that even with very fine grinds (which create high resistance), the machine will not stall. It is a sign of a robust hydraulic architecture in the Rivelia, despite its smaller size.

### **3.4. Thermal Management: The Thermoblock**

All machines in this price bracket (€300-€600) utilize **Thermoblock** technology rather than boilers.

* **Speed:** Thermoblocks heat only the water needed for the immediate shot, allowing the machine to go from "off" to "ready" in under 60 seconds.  
* **Steam Transition:** The limitation is that the machine cannot steam milk and brew coffee simultaneously. It must "pulse" the heater to reach steam temperatures (approx. 120°C+). DeLonghi’s modern thermoblocks are exceptionally fast, reducing the wait time between brewing espresso and steaming milk to mere seconds.



## **4\. In-Depth Analysis: DeLonghi Rivelia (EXAM440.35)**

The **DeLonghi Rivelia** represents a radical departure from the brand's traditional design language. It is a compact, lifestyle-oriented machine that prioritizes aesthetics and user flexibility. For the Belgian market, specifically the manual milk version (EXAM440.35.B), it stands as a formidable contender in the sub-€600 category.

### **4.1. The "Bean Switch" System: A Game Changer?**

The Rivelia’s most marketed feature is the **Bean Switch System**.7

* **Mechanism:** The machine is supplied with **two interchangeable bean hoppers** (250g each). The user can physically twist and lift the hopper off the machine.  
* **Software Integration:** Changing beans is not instant; there are beans already in the burr chamber. The Rivelia’s touchscreen interface offers a "Switch" mode. When activated, the machine offers to either brew a coffee with the remaining beans or "purge" them (grind them out) to clear the path for the new beans.21  
* **User Scenario:** This is invaluable for households where one partner drinks decaf and the other regular, or where users switch between a dark roast for cappuccinos and a single-origin light roast for espresso. It solves the "commitment" problem of filling a standard hopper.

### **4.2. Interface and User Profiles**

* **Screen:** 3.5-inch Full-Touch Color TFT.4  
* **Coffee Routines:** The software is adaptive. It learns the user's habits. If "User 1" typically drinks a cappuccino at 8:00 AM, the machine will prioritize that icon on the screen in the morning.  
* **Profile Depth:** It supports **4 User Profiles**.22 Each profile acts as a silo, saving specific modifications for every drink recipe (length, temperature, intensity).  
* **Visuals:** The interface relies heavily on "rich animations".3 The swiping motion is fluid, mirroring the responsiveness of a smartphone, which directly addresses the user's desire for a modern touchscreen experience.

### **4.3. Dimensions and Capacities**

* **Compact Footprint:** Measuring **245 x 430 x 385 mm**, the Rivelia is designed for shallower countertops. The rounded corners ("squircle" design) soften its visual impact.  
* **The Water Tank Compromise:** To achieve this size, DeLonghi reduced the water tank capacity to **1.4 Liters**.20  
  * **Implication:** This is a critical consideration. Automated machines use significant water for rinsing (both on startup and shutdown). A 1.4L tank may require daily refilling for a two-person household, which some users find tedious.24

### **4.4. The Decaf Chute Issue**

While the Bean Switch system handles whole beans beautifully, several user reviews highlight a flaw with the **pre-ground bypass chute** (often used for occasional decaf on other machines).

* **Design Flaw:** Users report that the chute is narrow and prone to clogging, or that the machine fails to detect the powder effectively, leading to cancelled brew cycles.25  
* **Recommendation:** Rivelia owners should rely on the Bean Switch system for decaf (using whole beans in the second hopper) rather than the pre-ground chute.

### **4.5. Belgian Market Pricing for Rivelia**

* **EXAM440.35 (Manual Milk):** This model is the primary fit for the budget. Retailers like **Art & Craft** and **Krefel** have listed this model between **€550 and €615**.10 During promotional periods, it reliably dips below €600.28  
* **EXAM440.55 (LatteCrema):** The version with the automatic milk carafe generally commands a price of €699+. Unless a significant Black Friday clearance occurs 1, this version is likely out of the specified budget.



## **5\. In-Depth Analysis: DeLonghi Magnifica Plus (ECAM320.60 / ECAM320.70)**

The **Magnifica Plus** is a modernization of the classic Magnifica chassis. It effectively takes the robust internals of the Dinamica line and applies a premium touchscreen interface, creating a "feature-rich" mid-range option.

### **5.1. The Interface: True Touchscreen**

* **Screen:** Like the Rivelia, the Magnifica Plus boasts a **3.5-inch Full-Touch Color TFT display**.16  
* **User Experience:** The navigation is identical to the premium lines. Users can swipe through pages of drinks.  
* **Profiles:** It supports **4 User Profiles**.14 This allows for the creation of "My" drinks, where parameters are saved individually. The ease of naming and switching profiles is superior to the button-based toggle systems of cheaper models.

### **5.2. Drink Menu and Customization**

The Magnifica Plus offers an extensive menu of up to **18 beverages**.3

* **Classics:** Espresso, Coffee, Long, Americano, Doppio+.  
* **Milk Drinks (ECAM320.60/70):** Cappuccino, Latte Macchiato, Flat White, Cortado, Espresso Macchiato, Hot Milk.  
* **Cold Options:** The menu includes "Ice Coffee" and "Cold Americano".19 Note that these are not "cold brew" (which requires long steeping) but rather espresso brewed at a lower temp or intended to be brewed over ice.  
* **Dosing Power:** As noted in the technical architecture section, the Magnifica Plus distinguishes itself with a larger brew unit capacity. It can grind for up to 10 seconds for a standard shot and 12 seconds for a "Doppio+," yielding a puck weight of **15g+**.6 This capability makes it the superior choice for users who prioritize coffee strength and body.

### **5.3. Milk System: LatteCrema Hot**

The models ECAM320.60 and ECAM320.70 come equipped with the **LatteCrema Hot** carafe.

* **Texture Control:** A dial on the carafe allows the user to select from **three foam levels**: Dense (for Cappuccino), Creamy (for Latte), and Flat (for Hot Milk/Flat White).33 This mechanical adjustment is a significant advantage over lower-end systems that offer only one "universal" foam texture.  
* **Cleaning:** The carafe features an "Auto Clean" dial position that flushes the milk spout with steam and hot water, ensuring hygiene.

### **5.4. Physical Specifications and Maintenance**

* **Water Tank:** **1.9 Liters**.3 This large capacity significantly reduces the "refill anxiety" associated with smaller machines like the Rivelia.  
* **Noise Levels:** Some user reviews suggest the Magnifica Plus can be slightly noisier during operation compared to the sound-dampened premium models (like the PrimaDonna Soul), though it remains within acceptable limits for a domestic grinder.34

### **5.5. Belgian Market Pricing for Magnifica Plus**

* **Positioning:** The Magnifica Plus sits right on the edge of the budget. The list price is typically **€629 \- €649** at retailers like **Vanden Borre** and **Coolblue**.30  
* **The Deal Hunter's Target:** However, market data shows aggressive discounting. Prices as low as **€549** have been observed at retailers like **MediaMarkt** and **Amazon** during sales events.36  
* **Verdict:** This machine offers the highest feature-to-price ratio if purchased during a sale.



## **6\. In-Depth Analysis: DeLonghi Magnifica Evo Next (ECAM310.60)**

The **Magnifica Evo Next** is positioned as the successor to the highly successful Magnifica Evo. It serves as the gateway to the color-screen experience but entails specific compromises to hit a lower price point.

### **6.1. The Interface: The "Touch" Compromise**

It is critical to clarify the nature of the interface, as "touchscreen" can be ambiguous in marketing materials.

* **Display:** The machine features a **2.4-inch Color TFT** screen.5  
* **Interaction:** The screen itself is **not touch-sensitive**. Instead, it is surrounded by **"Soft Touch" buttons** (capacitive icons on the black bezel).5 The user looks at the screen to see the menu, but presses the buttons next to it to navigate (Up, Down, OK, Back).  
* **User Profiles:** The machine supports **3 User Profiles**.5  
* **Profile Identification:** Profiles are identified by **colors** rather than names or avatars.39 The user selects "Profile Blue" or "Profile Red," which may feel less personalized than the named profiles on the Rivelia.

### **6.2. Performance vs. The Plus**

* **Grinding:** The Evo Next generally doses slightly less coffee than the Plus. Grind time data suggests a maximum of **8-9 seconds** for standard shots, equating to roughly **13.5 grams** of coffee.40 While sufficient for a good espresso, it lacks the "punch" of the Plus's larger pucks.  
* **Milk System:** The included LatteCrema carafe is a simplified version. It typically produces **one standard foam texture** suitable for cappuccinos but lacks the mechanical dial to adjust froth density for flat whites.41

### **6.3. Belgian Pricing and Value**

* **Price:** This model is the clear budget leader. It is widely available in Belgium for **€399 \- €499**.42  
* **Value Proposition:** It delivers 80% of the core functionality (automatic milk, decent espresso, color screen) for roughly 60% of the price of the Magnifica Plus. If the user can forgive the lack of a "true" swipe touchscreen, this is an exceptional value.



## **7\. The Outlier: DeLonghi La Specialista Touch (EC9455)**

While the user's request implies a super-automatic machine (user profiles are rare on manuals), the snippet 15 introduces the **La Specialista Touch**.

* **Type:** Semi-Automatic (Portafilter) with assisted tamping and grinding.  
* **Touchscreen:** It features a similar **3.5" Touchscreen** to the Rivelia.  
* **Relevance:** This machine is for the user who *thinks* they want automation but actually enjoys the ritual of making coffee. It guides the user through the process ("Barista Guidance").  
* **Pricing:** It typically retails significantly higher, often **€650-€800** 44, and rarely dips below €600 unless older non-touch models are considered. Therefore, strictly for the \<€600 criteria, it is likely out of scope unless bought second-hand or open-box.



## **8\. Comparative Feature Analysis**

To visualize the trade-offs, the following comparative data aggregates specifications across the three viable contenders.

### **8.1. Specification Matrix**

| Feature | DeLonghi Rivelia (EXAM440.35) | DeLonghi Magnifica Plus (ECAM320.60) | DeLonghi Magnifica Evo Next (ECAM310.60) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :- |
| **Retail Price (Belgium Est.)** | €550 \- €615 (Manual Milk) | €549 \- €649 (Auto Milk) | €399 \- €499 (Auto Milk) |
| **Interface Type** | **Full Touchscreen** (Swipe) | **Full Touchscreen** (Swipe) | **Soft Touch Buttons** (Static) |
| **Display Size** | 3.5" Color TFT | 3.5" Color TFT | 2.4" Color TFT |

| **Milk System (in budget)** | Manual Wand (Steam) | **LatteCrema Hot (Auto)** | LatteCrema Hot (Auto) |
| **Milk Texture Settings** | Variable (Manual Control) | **3 Levels (Dense, Creamy, Light)** | 1 Level (Standard) |
| **Decaf Option** | Bean Switch (Excellent) | Bypass Chute (Standard) | Bypass Chute (Standard) |

### **8.2. Analysis of the Data**

* **The "Touch" Divide:** The data clearly separates the **Rivelia** and **Magnifica Plus** as "Tier 1" interface devices, while the **Evo Next** is "Tier 2." The swiping action on the Tier 1 devices allows for vastly superior menu navigation, particularly when customizing beverage volumes (dragging a slider vs. holding a button).  
* **Capacity vs. Compactness:** The **Magnifica Plus** wins on autonomy. Its 1.9L tank and larger drip tray mean less frequent maintenance interruptions compared to the Rivelia.  
* **The Milk Dilemma:** The most significant trade-off for the Rivelia in this price range is the lack of automatic milk. The user must manually froth milk. For a cappuccino lover who doesn't want to learn barista skills, the **Magnifica Plus** (which includes the auto carafe) is functionally superior, even if the Rivelia looks more modern.



## **9\. Belgian Market & Pricing Dynamics**

Successfully acquiring the right machine under €600 requires navigating the specific retail landscape of Belgium.

### **9.1. Retailer Profiles and Strategies**

* **Coolblue.be:** This retailer focuses on customer experience. They provide extensive video reviews and "starter kits." Their pricing for the **Magnifica Plus** is often competitive, and they are noted for reliable next-day delivery. They frequently bundle the Rivelia with a "Barista Pack" (glasses, beans) which adds value.35  
* **Vanden Borre (Fnac Darty):** Their "Lowest Price Guarantee" is a powerful tool. If a consumer finds the **Magnifica Plus** listed cheaper on a Belgian competitor's site (e.g., Bol.com), Vanden Borre will often match the price. They are a reliable source for the standard Magnifica Plus models.11  
* **Art & Craft:** Based in Ghent but operating nationally online, they often stock specific color variants (like the Onyx Black Rivelia) that might be sold out elsewhere. Their pricing on the manual-milk Rivelia is often very aggressive.27  
* **MediaMarkt:** Known for "Mega Deals" and "BTW-Vrij" (VAT-free) days. These events are the best opportunity to snag a machine that is normally €699 (like the fully loaded Rivelia) for under €600.

### **9.2. Black Friday 2025 Predictions**

Based on the provided research snippets 1, the forecast for Black Friday 2025 is highly favorable for the buyer.

* **Trend:** DeLonghi uses Black Friday to clear inventory of "current" models before "next-year" refreshes.  
* **Specific Prediction:** The **Magnifica Plus**, currently sitting just above the budget (€629), is statistically likely to see a 15-20% reduction, bringing it to **€520-€550**.  
* **Specific Prediction:** The **Rivelia (Auto Milk)**, currently \~€699, may see a "doorbuster" price of **€599**, bringing the automatic milk version into the user's budget range for the first time.



## **10\. Critical Assessment & Known Issues**

No machine is perfect. The research has uncovered specific known issues that the user must be aware of to avoid post-purchase dissonance.

### **10.1. Rivelia: The "Bypass" Frustration**

While the Rivelia is praised for its Bean Switch, its handling of **pre-ground coffee** (via the bypass chute) is widely criticized.25 The sensor often fails to detect the ground coffee, or the chute clogs, cancelling the brewing process and dumping the dry coffee.

* **Implication:** If the user plans to use the bypass chute frequently for decaf, the Rivelia is a poor choice. They should instead use the *second bean hopper* for decaf beans, which works perfectly.

### **10.2. Magnifica Plus: Noise Levels**

Reviews indicate that the Magnifica Plus, while producing excellent coffee, is not the quietest machine on the market.34 The grinding process and the movement of the brew group are audible. In an open-plan kitchen (common in modern Belgian apartments), this morning noise might be a consideration.

### **10.3. Evo Next: The "Soft Touch" Confusion**

A common point of frustration for buyers of the Evo Next is the expectation of a touchscreen. Users often try to tap the screen icons, only to realize they must press the buttons *next* to the screen. This UI friction can feel dated compared to the fluid experience of the Plus or Rivelia.



## **11\. Final Recommendations**

Based on the exhaustive analysis of technical specifications, market pricing, and user requirements, the following recommendations are tailored to the Belgian consumer.

### **11.1. The "Performance & Value" Champion**

**Recommendation:** **DeLonghi Magnifica Plus (ECAM320.60)**

* **Why:** It is the only machine that fulfills **all** criteria without compromise: true touchscreen, 4 named user profiles, and an automatic milk system. Its larger brew unit delivers superior coffee intensity, and its larger water tank offers practical autonomy.  
* **Buying Strategy:** Its standard price (\~€629) is slightly over budget. The user is strongly advised to utilize price-comparison tools (like Tweakers.net or idealo.be) or wait for a specific retailer promotion (MediaMarkt/Vanden Borre) to secure it for **€549-€599**.

### **11.2. The "Design & Innovation" Alternative**

**Recommendation:** **DeLonghi Rivelia (EXAM440.35.B)**

* **Why:** For users who value aesthetics, compactness, and the flexibility of the **Bean Switch System** (e.g., easy switching to Decaf beans), this is the superior modern appliance. The interface is the best in class.  
* **The Trade-Off:** To stay under €600, the user must accept the **manual milk frother**. If the user is willing to steam their own milk, this machine offers a more "premium" feel than the Magnifica series.

### **11.3. The "Budget Safety" Choice**

**Recommendation:** **DeLonghi Magnifica Evo Next (ECAM310.60)**

* **Why:** If the €600 limit is a "hard ceiling" and the user wants to spend significantly less (e.g., €450), this machine is the answer. It provides solid coffee and automatic milk.  
* **The Trade-Off:** The user must compromise on the interface (Buttons vs. Touch) and profile depth (Color codes vs. Names).

### **11.4. Conclusion**

For a user specifying "Touchscreen" and "2 User Profiles" under €600 in Belgium, the **DeLonghi Magnifica Plus** is the technically correct answer. It bridges the gap between mid-range pricing and high-end features, offering a robust, touch-enabled experience that justifies the investment over the entry-level Evo Next.
