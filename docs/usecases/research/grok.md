### Key Points
- Based on current research, only two DeLonghi espresso machines meet all your criteria (at least 2 user profiles, touchscreen display, under 600 EUR): the Magnifica Plus (ECAM320.60.B) and the Magnifica Evo Next (ECAM310.60.B). Both are fully automatic bean-to-cup models with customizable profiles for saving coffee preferences like strength, volume, and temperature.
- Prices are influenced by ongoing Black Friday promotions (active as of November 25, 2025), bringing them below 600 EUR; without deals, they may exceed this limit. Evidence suggests these are the most affordable options with the required features, though availability can vary.
- Neither model is strictly necessary for milk-based drinks since a milk system is optional, but both include an automatic one for convenience—research indicates you can bypass it for black coffee.
- Controversy around super-automatic machines often involves maintenance ease and longevity, but user reviews lean toward high satisfaction for DeLonghi's reliability when properly cared for.
