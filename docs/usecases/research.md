# Deep Research Agents

Deep Research represents a significant shift from standard "Chatbots" to "Agentic AI." While a standard chatbot predicts the next word to give you a quick answer, a **Deep Research Agent** acts like a dedicated research assistant.

When you give it a complex task, it doesn't answer immediately. Instead, it pauses to "think," creates a plan, browses dozens of websites, reads reviews, cross-references prices, and compiles a comprehensive report.

## How It Works

1.  **Strategy Phase**: The AI analyzes your prompt to understand the constraints (e.g., "Belgium," "Touchscreen," "Under €600").
2.  **Data Gathering**: It actively browses the live internet. It visits manufacturer sites for specs and retailer sites (like Coolblue or Vanden Borre) for current pricing.
3.  **Synthesis**: It filters out ads and irrelevant data, comparing the findings against your specific requirements.
4.  **Reporting**: It generates a structured document with citations, ensuring the advice is based on real-time data, not training data from last year.



## Try It Yourself: The "Shopping Assistant" Test

To see the power of Deep Research, we need a prompt that is too difficult for a standard AI model. A standard model would likely hallucinate prices or recommend old models.

Run this prompt in **Perplexity (Comet)**, **Grok**, or **Gemini**.

::: tip 🛍️ Deep Research Prompt
I want to buy a DeLonghi espresso machine and need a deep research comparison.

**Requirements:**
1. The machine must be from the brand **DeLonghi**.
2. It must support **at least 2 user profiles** (for example, saving different coffee preferences for two people).
3. It must have a **touchscreen display**.
4. The **price must be below 600 EUR**.
5. A milk system (milk frother, milk carafe, etc.) is **optional**, not required.
6. Focus on **current prices in Belgian online shops**, for example well-known Belgian or EU sites that deliver to Belgium. Please make sure the prices reflect the **current period and any Black Friday or similar promotions** that are active right now.

**Tasks:**
1. Identify all DeLonghi espresso machines that meet the above requirements.
2. For each model, provide:
    - Full **model name** and **short description**
    - **Key features** (grinder type, pressure, customisation options, size, water tank, etc.)
    - Whether it has **2 or more profiles** and how they work
    - Details about the **touchscreen** (size/quality if available)
    - Whether it includes a **milk system** (and which type, if present)
    - **Current price** (in EUR) from at least 2–3 Belgian or EU online shops that ship to Belgium
    - Indication if the price includes a **Black Friday or special promotion** (if applicable)
    - Links to the product pages

3. Create a **comparison table** of all the shortlisted models with:
    - Model name
    - Price range (min–max)
    - Number of profiles
    - Touchscreen (Yes/No + notes)
    - Milk system (None / Manual wand / Automatic carafe)
    - Pros and cons short summary

4. Based on this analysis, give:
    - Your **top 3 recommendations** under 600 EUR, with a short explanation for each
    - A final **recommendation tailored to a user in Belgium** who wants at least 2 profiles and a touchscreen but does not really need a milk system.

Please use only **up-to-date information** and clearly state the **date of the prices** you found.

### Why this prompt is challenging
*   **Geographic Lock**: It forces the AI to ignore US/UK sites and look for Belgian retailers (Coolblue.be, Bol.com, Vanden Borre).
*   **Feature Intersection**: Finding a machine with *User Profiles* AND *Touchscreen* under *€600* is difficult; these features are usually reserved for premium (€800+) models. The AI must filter strictly.
*   **Live Pricing**: Prices change daily. The AI cannot rely on its memory; it *must* browse the web live.

## Going Further: Gemini's "Artifacts"

Deep Research isn't just about text. Advanced models like Gemini and Claude can create **interactive tools** based on their research.

After Gemini completed the research report, we asked it to: *"Turn this comparison table into a fully functional HTML webpage that I can open in my browser."*

Instead of just giving us text, it wrote code.

### The Resulting Webpage
Below is the actual webpage Gemini built from scratch based on the coffee machine data. It includes a responsive design and a clean comparison table.
